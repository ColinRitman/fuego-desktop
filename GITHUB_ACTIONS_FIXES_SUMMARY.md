# GitHub Actions Build Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to make the GitHub Actions builds green for the fuego-desktop repository.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Package List Files
- **Problem**: Cache configurations referenced non-existent package list files
- **Solution**: Created `apt-packages.txt` and `brew-packages.txt` files with required dependencies

### 2. Qt Environment Variables
- **Problem**: `Qt5_DIR` environment variable was not set in workflows
- **Solution**: Added Qt environment variable setup steps to all workflows

### 3. STARK CLI Binary Paths
- **Problem**: Workflows referenced incorrect paths for STARK CLI binaries
- **Solution**: Updated all workflows to use `bin/xfg-stark-cli` path consistently

### 4. Windows Build Configuration
- **Problem**: Windows builds used inconsistent dependency management
- **Solution**: Standardized Windows builds to use vcpkg for all dependencies

### 5. CMake Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: CMakeLists.txt had hardcoded Qt path and missing cryptonote library creation
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated Qt path to use environment variable
  - Added proper cryptonote library creation
  - Fixed platform-specific source handling

### 6. QREncode Configuration
- **Problem**: QREncode.cmake had strict requirements that could fail
- **Solution**: Added fallback configuration for Windows builds

### 7. Boost Configuration
- **Problem**: Boost configuration was inconsistent across platforms
- **Solution**: Enhanced CryptoNoteWallet.cmake with better Boost handling

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `apt-packages.txt` - APT package list for caching
- `brew-packages.txt` - Homebrew package list for caching
- `download-stark-cli.sh` - STARK CLI download script
- `STARK_CLI_INTEGRATION_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Integration documentation
- `test_build_config.sh` - Build configuration test script

### Modified Files
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Fixed all build jobs
- `.github/workflows/check.yml` - Fixed all check jobs
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Fixed all release jobs
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Fixed Qt path and cryptonote library creation
- `CryptoNoteWallet.cmake` - Enhanced Boost configuration
- `QREncode.cmake` - Added fallback configuration

## Workflow Improvements

### Build Workflow (`build.yml`)
- Added Qt environment variable setup
- Fixed STARK CLI binary paths
- Standardized dependency installation
- Added proper error handling

### Check Workflow (`check.yml`)
- Added Qt environment variable setup
- Fixed STARK CLI binary paths
- Added caching for dependencies
- Improved build process

### Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
- Added Qt environment variable setup
- Fixed STARK CLI binary paths
- Standardized Windows build process
- Added proper artifact handling

## Platform-Specific Fixes

### Windows
- Use vcpkg for all dependencies
- Proper Qt installation and configuration
- Correct STARK CLI binary handling

### Ubuntu 22.04/24.04
- Consistent package installation
- Proper Qt environment setup
- Correct STARK CLI binary paths

### macOS Intel/Apple Silicon
- Proper Qt installation and configuration
- Correct STARK CLI binary handling
- Platform-specific binary downloads

## Testing

The `test_build_config.sh` script verifies:
- All required files exist
- Scripts have proper permissions
- GitHub Actions workflows are present
- Build configuration is complete

## Next Steps

1. **Test the workflows**: Push changes to trigger GitHub Actions
2. **Monitor builds**: Watch for any remaining issues
3. **Iterate**: Fix any additional issues that arise
4. **Document**: Update documentation as needed

## Expected Results

With these fixes, all GitHub Actions workflows should:
- ✅ Build successfully on all platforms
- ✅ Pass all checks and tests
- ✅ Create proper releases
- ✅ Include STARK CLI binaries
- ✅ Have consistent configurations

## Troubleshooting

If builds still fail:
1. Check the specific error messages in GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Ensure Qt environment variables are properly set
4. Check STARK CLI binary downloads and permissions
5. Review CMake configuration for platform-specific issues

## Support

For issues with these fixes:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. Verify all files are present and have correct permissions
3. Test the build configuration locally if possible
4. Review the integration documentation for STARK CLI setup
