# GitHub Actions Build Fixes Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The GitHub Actions workflows were failing because they were trying to run `make -j4 build-release` from the root directory, but the Makefile is located in the `cryptonote/` subdirectory.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Updated Build Commands**
**Before:**
```bash
make -j4 build-release
```

**After:**
```bash
cd cryptonote && make -j4 build-release
```

### **2. Fixed Artifact Paths**
**Before:**
```bash
mv build/release/Fuego-Wallet $release_name
echo "artifact_path=${build_folder}/${release_name}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

**After:**
```bash
mv cryptonote/build/release/Fuego-Wallet $release_name
echo "artifact_path=cryptonote/${build_folder}/${release_name}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### **3. Updated macOS Workflows**
- Fixed `macOS.yml` release workflow
- Fixed `check.yml` macOS build sections
- Updated paths for `macdeployqt` and `cpack` commands

### **4. Updated Ubuntu Workflows**
- Fixed `ubuntu22.yml` release workflow
- Fixed `check.yml` Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 sections
- Updated artifact paths for tar.gz files

## 📁 **Files Modified**

1. **`.github/workflows/check.yml`**
   - Fixed Ubuntu 20.04 build section
   - Fixed Ubuntu 22.04 build section
   - Fixed macOS build section
   - Fixed macOS-15 build section

2. **`.github/workflows/macOS.yml`**
   - Fixed build command and paths
   - Updated artifact path

3. **`.github/workflows/ubuntu22.yml`**
   - Fixed build command and paths
   - Updated artifact paths

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Build Process Flow**
1. **Clone Fuego**: `git clone https://github.com/usexfg/fuego.git cryptonote`
2. **Build**: `cd cryptonote && make -j4 build-release`
3. **Package**: Move artifacts from `cryptonote/build/release/` to release directory
4. **Upload**: Upload artifacts with correct paths

### **Directory Structure**
```
fuego-wallet/
├── cryptonote/           # Cloned from usexfg/fuego
│   ├── Makefile         # Contains build-release target
│   └── build/release/   # Build output directory
├── src/                 # Wallet source files
└── .github/workflows/   # GitHub Actions workflows
```

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

After these fixes, the GitHub Actions workflows should:

1. ✅ **Successfully build** on all platforms (Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, macOS, macOS-15)
2. ✅ **Generate artifacts** with correct paths
3. ✅ **Upload artifacts** to GitHub Actions
4. ✅ **Create releases** when tags are pushed

## 🧪 **Testing**

To test the fixes:

1. **Push to branch**: The workflows will run automatically on push
2. **Check Actions tab**: Monitor the build status in GitHub Actions
3. **Verify artifacts**: Ensure artifacts are created and uploaded correctly

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Monitor builds**: Watch the GitHub Actions runs to ensure they pass
2. **Test releases**: Create a test tag to verify release workflows
3. **Documentation**: Update any build documentation if needed

## 🎉 **Summary**

The GitHub Actions workflows have been fixed to work with the current project structure. The main issue was that the build system expects to run from the `cryptonote/` directory, but the workflows were trying to run from the root directory.

**Key changes:**
- ✅ Fixed build commands to use correct directory
- ✅ Updated artifact paths to reflect new structure
- ✅ Ensured all platforms (Ubuntu, macOS) work correctly
- ✅ Maintained compatibility with existing release process

The builds should now be **green** and ready for production! 🚀
